# VideoOverWiFi
Intranet-based Video over Wi-Fi(VoWi-Fi) System using Socket Programming in Java
By capturing video frames on the server, transmitting them through socket communication,and displaying them in real-time on the client side using Java andJavaFX, the project offers a practical exploration of key concepts.
The project serves as a valuable learning experience, providing hands-on exposure to implementing video streaming solutions. It encourages the development of skills in designing and troubleshooting networked applications while fostering a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of multimedia data transmission.The server-client architecture,coupled with the dynamic display ofvideo frames,exemplifies the capabilities and potential applications of socket programming in the context of video over Wi-Fi systems within a limited access point.
